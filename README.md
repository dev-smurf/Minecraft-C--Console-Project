# Minecraft-C--Console-Project
The C# Console Project allows users to modify the durability and force attributes of objects stored in a text file. The program operates by accessing a designated file path: "C:\data\420-04A-FX", where the text file containing object data is located. Users can edit the attributes within this file to customize the behavior of objects in the system.
